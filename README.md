# Interesting content for Python/data science
A list of interesting content I came across during my python/data science learning journey

## Data cleaning
* [Real Python article on data cleaning](https://realpython.com/python-data-cleaning-numpy-pandas/)

## Python
* [Real Python article on Regex](https://realpython.com/regex-python/)  
* Regex for working with textual data can be so powerful. I feel there are a lot of articles out there with the basics, but few have the clarity of this one. Also, great examples in there. 

## Pandas
* [Pandas historgram from dataframe](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.hist.html)  
* Hands on Data Analysis with Pandas by Stefanie Molin :books:

## Scikit-learn
* [Train test split in scikit-learn](https://realpython.com/train-test-split-python-data/)

## Machine learning
* Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow by Aurélien Géron :books:
